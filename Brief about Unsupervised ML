## Unsupervised Machine Learning
The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.

The unsupervised learning algorithm can be further categorized into two types of problems:
i) Clustering and ii). Association 

### i)Clustering: 
Clustering is a method of grouping the objects into clusters such that objects with most similarities remains into a group and has less or no similarities with the objects of another group. Cluster analysis finds the commonalities between the data objects and categorizes them as per the presence and absence of those commonalities

### ii) Association:
An association rule is an unsupervised learning method which is used for finding the relationships between variables in the large database. It determines the set of items that occurs together in the dataset. Association rule makes marketing strategy more effective. Such as people who buy X item (suppose a bread) are also tend to purchase Y (Butter/Jam) item. A typical example of Association rule is Market Basket Analysis


### Popular unsupervised machin elearning algorithms:
K-means clustering,
KNN (k-nearest neighbors),
Hierarchal clustering,
Anomaly detection,
Neural Networks,
